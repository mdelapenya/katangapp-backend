# Katanga Backend Application

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/swcraftersclm/katangapp-backend.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/swcraftersclm/katangapp-backend)

# Contributing
In order to contribute to the project, please fork the repository, add the
functionality you want, or fix any bug you like, and send a pull request to the
main repository, which is hosted here:[https://github.com/craftsmanship-toledo/katangapp-backend](https://github.com/craftsmanship-toledo/katangapp-backend).

Our team will work on its review and try to merge it into the `dev` branch. For
that reason, **always send the pull requests to the dev branch**, which is the
development branch for this purpose.

The `master` branch is a frozen branch, only updated with releases of the
project.

# Workspace set-up
First of all, you need to install `Play! Framework` into your machine. It is
pretty well documented in their website, so please visit it for more info:
[https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.3.x/Installing](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.3.x/Installing)

As the project is based on `Play! Framework`, you should install a plugin in
your IDE. Whether you use Eclipse or IntelliJ, there are plugins that support
it. Please visit this page for more info:
[https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.3.x/IDE](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.3.x/IDE)

## Managed dependencies
The dependency on `katangapp-api` project is directly fetched from Github, using
[https://jitpack.io](https://jitpack.io) service, which translates Github tags
into managed dependencies.

Then, import the project into your IDE, and voil√†!

# Running the application
To run the application, browse your workspace to project's folder, open a shell
and type:
``
activator run
``
It will open a port in your local machine (default is 9000), where you could
test the application: open a browser and go to `http://localhost:9000`. It
should display the default `Play! Framework` main page.

To verify the business logic of the application, go to
`http://localhost:9000/main`, that represents the endpoint of the service
that calculates the closest bus stops to a specific point. It needs the
following parameters to work:

 - lt: Latitude of a location (Double)
 - ln: Longitude of a location (Double)
 - r: Radius to use when searching for the closest bus stops (Integer)

In example: `http://localhost:9000/main?lt=39.862658&ln=-4.025088&r=500`

#### Favorite Bus stops

To verify the business logic for the `favorite bus stop` feature of the
application, go to `http://localhost:9000/favorite`, that represents the
endpoint of the service that calculates the routes of a specific bus
stop. It needs the following parameters to work:

 - busStopId: The identifier of the bus top

In example: `http://localhost:9000/favorite/P001`

## Available Stores
The application offers four endpoints to retrieve the data it uses, in JSON
format, two for the bus routes, describing each route and its bus stops, and
the other two for the bus stops, describing each bus stop. The endpoints are:

#### Routes endpoint:
```
http://localhost:9000/api/routes
http://localhost:9000/api/routes/:routeId
```
#### Bus Stops endpoint:
```
http://localhost:9000/api/busStops
http://localhost:9000/api/busStops/:busStopId
```

### Pretty Printing JSON output

Adding the parameter `prettyPrint` with value `true` or `1`, will return a
prettified JSON.

```
http://localhost:9000/main?lt=39.862658&ln=-4.025088&r=500?prettyPrint=1
http://localhost:9000/api/routes?prettyPrint=1
http://localhost:9000/api/routes/:routeId?prettyPrint=true
http://localhost:9000/api/busStops?prettyPrint=1
http://localhost:9000/api/busStops/:busStopId?prettyPrint=true
```

## Other endpoints
The application offers an endpoint to check the status of every different
service that the application uses. At this moment of the development, it
only uses the former system, but it will add more health checks once more
services are used.

### Status / Health Check
The status service will check that an specific query to the former system
is returning a valid result.
```
http://localhost:9000/status
```

## Backward compatibility
To verify that the former system' business logic is working as expected, go to
`http://localhost:9000/unauto`, that represents the endpoint of the former
system. It needs the following parameters to work:

 - idl: Route identifier (String)
 - idp: Bus Stop identifier (String)
 - ido: Bus Stop Order (String)

In example: `http://localhost:9000/unauto?idl=41&idp=P001&ido=1.00000`

## Swagger
[Swagger](http://swagger.io/) is a simple yet powerful representation of
Katanga's RESTful API. With a Swagger-enabled API, we get an interactive
documentation, client SDK generation and discoverability. To visit the
endpoints documentation, please visit following URL:

`http://localhost:9000/assets/lib/swagger-ui/index.html?/url=http://localhost:9000/api-docs`
